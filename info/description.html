<p>
Nicola is taking a much needed vacation.  
He'll be backpacking around some lesser-known countries.  
Each has its own unique currency.
</p>
<p>
When making purchases, Nicola would like to use the minimum number of coins possible.  
For example, Outer Leftopia has coins with denomination 1, 3, and 5 shillings.  
He wants to buy a souvenir that costs 13 shillings.  He can do that using two 5 shilling coins and one 3 shilling coin.
</p>
<p>
You can assume Nicola has access to an infinite number of coins of each denomination.  
(He has a large bank account and access to an ATM).
</p>


<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> Two arguments. The first argument is an int: the price of the purchase.  
    The second is a list of ints: the denominations of available coins.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> int. The minimum number of coins Nicola can use to make the purchase.
    If the price cannot be made with the available denominations, return {% if interpreter.slug == "js-node" %}<i>undefined</i>{% else %}<i>None</i>{% endif %}.
</p>

    <strong>How it is used: </strong>
    <i>Besides helping Nicola make change, this is an example of a problem in combinatorial optimization.</i>
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Precondition:</strong>
    <i>Inputs are all positive integers.</i>
